<h1 class="subheader-text">About Ryan Salva</h1>
<div class="primary-container"> 
<main class="main-content">
<p class="paragraph-text">Ryan Salva was born on June 30th, 1995 and raised in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He currently lives with his parents, Shawn and Paul, and his pet dog, Santo, whom he loves dearly. Ryan discovered his passion in computers before he entered kindergarten. His interest and curiosity with computer technology only grew with playing video games, learning about various types of software, and witnessing the evolution of computing technologies throughout the previous three decades.</p> 
    <p class="paragraph-text">Ryan has earned an Associate’s Degree in Software Development and a Bachelor’s degree in Programming Technology. His favorite languages to learn were Python, SQL, PowerShell, and Control Language for IBM iSeries. He loved learning Python for its accessibility and because it was fun to teach other developers. Ryan enjoys programming with SQL since it fulfills his satisfaction with database management and complex problem solving. He also quickly became attached to PowerShell as it allowed him to complete basic tasks within Windows. And Control Language was fun for him to learn because he liked utilizing IBM iSeries servers and experimenting with them.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-text">Ryan is employed at Jockey International Inc. where he develops ETL programs (as well as dozens of packages/automations) with RedPoint Data Management. He has filled the role of SME on RedPoint Data Management. Ryan has also developed and managed databases with SQL Server Management Studio. Over the years, he also became proficient with SQL queries, managing databases, building stored procedures + jobs, and managing security + roles. </p>
    <p class="paragraph-text">One of the most challenging and difficult projects that Ryan has worked on was a recent project. He developed half of the integrations at his job for their ecommerce business in the U.K. This involved constructing several large components to handle transferring and receiving data between their UK Distribution Center and their backend systems. This project needed to be finished within a month and the communication was especially burdensome since the U.K. contacts would be done with their workday when their’s were just beginning.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-text">Someone who inspired Ryan was a guy named Michael who filled a mentorship role at Jockey. He has since retired and passed the torch on to Ryan. Michael taught him a lot about SQL, ETL development, and handling several processes and systems at Jockey International. From that moment on, Ryan has trained new hires on how to use their ETL tool (RedPoint Data Management), which involved them learning how to develop entire applications and applying these applications in production. He also trained a few interns and full-time hires on SQL Server Management Studio to become proficient in developing databases from scratch and supporting production databases. </p>
    <p class="paragraph-text">Additionally, Ryan currently mentors a 6th grader at a local middle school named Damien. He provides guidance and lets Damien talk to him about his home and school life. They often play card games together during their talking sessions. Ryan also occasionally helps Damien with finishing his homework. Although he originally never saw himself as the manager type, Ryan envisions himself managing a team of developers for a web company in the future since he enjoys guiding others towards a path of success and watching them grow.
