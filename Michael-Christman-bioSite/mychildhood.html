<h1>Early Years</h1>
<hr>
<h2>1999-2014</h2>
<hr>
<p>I was born on November 1st, 1999. I attended Whittier in my pre-K and kindergarten years, but then I moved to
Jeffery in first grade and I stayed there all the way through fifth grade. We had many educational field trip
opportunities such as going to the Safety Center to learn about gun safety and stranger danger. We also had incentive
overnight field trips, like the Camp Timberlee field trip we went on in fifth grade. From sixth to eighth grade, I 
went to Lance Middle School. Before I discovered Lakeview, I was actually thinking about going to my home school, 
which would've been Tremper for where I was located, but I chose Lakeview instead. My cousin really convinced that 
this was a great school and that I should spend my time there. Needless to say, I didn't regret it, not one bit. I 
loved my time at Lakeview. I found out it was a choice school for people who want to work with technology in one of 
three tracks (Biomedical, Engineering, and IT). When it came tothe time to make a decision, I chose the IT track 
because I loved computers and that made me want to become a web programmer someday in the near future.</p>
