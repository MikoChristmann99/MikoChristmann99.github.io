<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<h2>The Introduction Page</h2>
<hr>
<p>My name is Michael Christman. I'm currently a senior in high school and 18 years old (I talk more in depth about 
my high school years on the page named "Current", click on the link above). I have been diagnosed as being on the 
autism spectrum, which put me in the special needs category. I still can use help sometimes, but I 
have become much more independent and self-sufficient over the years. My social skills have significantly developed
throughout my whole life. I have a younger brother who is a junior in high school (he's 16 years old, going to be 
turning 17 on March 8th). I also live with my parents; my mom is 56 and my dad just turned 61 like a week ago (I know
I have older parents, but that's not necessarily a bad thing). My favorite foods are pizza, cheeseburgers, and lasagna. My 
favorite beverage is root beer. My hobbies are playing video games, talking to my family, and spending time on the 
computer or on one of our IPads. My favorite movies are It's a Wonderful Life, Goodfellas, and Planes Trains 
and Automobiles.</p>
