<h1>Future Years</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Years after High School</h2>
<hr>
<p>I plan to go to Gateway to get my Associate's or Bachelor's degree in Web Programming, which will be my major
in college. After college, I would probably want to settle down, start a family, raise some kids, and work a
full time job in IT.</p>
