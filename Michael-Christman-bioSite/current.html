<h2>Present Day</h2>
<hr>
<p>I'm a senior currently attending Lakeview Technology Academy. I have been going there for all four years of my 
high school career and I'm graduating in a few months. Even though I am 18, I'm not driving yet. However, I'm working
on it. I plan to start taking  drivers ed classes this month. Also, I work at Festival Foods in the bagger position. 
I started working there in August 2017. I wanted to begin working during the summer to earn some money to pay for my 
college tuition. I enjoyed my years at Lakeview and these four years were the most favorite time of my life. I had
family, friends, and teachers who supported me with my problems and I got through them. I'm planning to go to Gateway
Technical College in the fall of 2018. Hopefully, by that time, I'll be driving myself to school. More on that in the
Future Years section of my website.</p>
